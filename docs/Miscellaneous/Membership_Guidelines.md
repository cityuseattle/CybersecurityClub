# Membership Guidelines

We're excited to have you as a part of the Cybersecurity Club! Here are some guidelines to ensure that we maintain a respectful and productive environment:

## Communication

* Be respectful of other members' ideas and opinions.
* Keep discussions focused on cybersecurity-related topics.
* When disagreeing with others, critique the idea, not the person.

## Collaboration

* Be willing to share your knowledge and experience with others.
* When working on a team project, commit to doing your fair share of the work.
* Recognize and appreciate the contributions of others.

## Ethics

* Practice ethical hacking. We only hack systems that we have been explicitly given permission to hack.
* Respect the privacy of others. Do not share another member's personal information without their consent.
* Do not use the skills you learn in the club for malicious purposes.
